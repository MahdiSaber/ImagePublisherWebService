# Image Publishing Restful Web Service
This project has been done as part of my Object Oriented Software Construction Course in RWTH-Aachen. The main goal of this project is to develop a Web service using JAX-RS for publishing images with respect to HATEOS concepts regarding good design.In addition to the backend, I have developed a client application to interact with the web service.

Please contact me if you have any further requests/questions.
